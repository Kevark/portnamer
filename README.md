# portnamer
A Slack bot that checks on common network ports such as 80 for HTTP or 22 for SSH.

## Installation
To install you'll need to:

1. `git clone` this repository.
2. `cp .env.example .env`
3. Enter your bot token you got from Slack and enter it in the .env file
4. Run `npm install`
5. Finally, `npm start`

## Usage
You can either mention `@portnamer` in a channel after you invite it, or DM it directly. Start by saying either `hi` or `help`.

## TODO
- [ ] Get random port intent - need to conversationalize it
- [ ] Quiz intent - Add a way to keep questions coming
- [ ] Use NLP service instead of Regex

And there's more but too lazy to think about them? :/

## Contributions
There's so many ways to make this better and I have little time to work on it. If you like it and might think of using it for fun or productivity, you should contribute!

Thank you! :)
